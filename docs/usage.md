# Usage (WIP)

Using the system is relatively straight forward once it has been set up.

## APIs

You can search for `@Controller` in the code base and see all available methods inside the controller.

## Events

You can search for `.publish(` in the code base to find events being published. You can then create an application and queue that listens to the messages being published.

## Types

If you are using TypeScript to create your applications, you can use the provided types and constants from the `bot-data` and `bot-manager-data` libraries.
